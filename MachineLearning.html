                    <b>Assignment 1:</b> is to classify images of histopathology by using in-depth
                    learning
                    methods learned during the course.
                    The system can classify images of tissue samples into 8 different categories with an accuracy of
                    97%.

                    <b>Assignment 2:</b>
                    At this point we have downloaded the classified layers of the
                    pre-trained model because the weights are aimed at classifying images that are different from our
                    training images.
                    For example, the VGG models practiced on ImageNet images that include images of various animals and
                    objects. The images in the database do not show the histopathological images that our project needs
                    to classify, so the upper layers in the pre-trained model do not have the ability to classify these
                    images.
                    We froze the lower layers of the model so as not to change their weight values ​​while training the
                    upper layers.
                    We added our top layers to the model and continued the training process when in practice at this
                    point only the weights of the top layers change. The weights of the lower layers whose function is
                    to extract the properties of the image do not change.

                    <b>Assignment 3:</b>
                    In the
                    second step we loosened the bottom layers and continued to train the entire model to further improve
                    the accuracy percentages we received.
                    Here it is important to choose the optimizer and its settings because the model is already close to
                    the optimum and should proceed gently.
                    In our model we chose to use an SGD optimizer with a relatively high learning constant that brought
                    us to a 97% prediction accuracy.
