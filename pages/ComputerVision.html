                    <b>The purpose of the project</b> is to count the vehicles in the traffic square from the flight of
                    a drone, each vehicle will be marked at any given moment with its unique number and
                    indicate the number of vehicles in the square and those waiting to enter it. Each vehicle will leave
                    a trail of movement.

                    <b>First step Image stabilization:</b>
                    We positioned the video as opposed to rotating the skimmer as
                    follows: The stable area in the video is the square, we will use canny to find the contours and then
                    'HoughCircles' to find its circle, then we made from it Mask which We moved to
                    'goodFeaturesToTrack' to find the points of interest only in this area, after that we will use
                    'calcOpticalFlowPyrLK' to check how these group of points move between the frames and we will
                    throw this into the whole picture.
                    <hr>
                    <b>Step two Tracking the vehicles:</b>
                    We work on 2 consecutive frames each time to convert them to shades of gray and calculate the
                    difference between them with the help
                    of 'absdiff', we actually get an image of contours, blur it to remove noise and perform a threshold
                    to get a binary image, we will 'closing' Remove additional noises and then we will perform -
                    'dilate' is actually obtained mask, cleaning the frame created by the rotation movement is performed
                    with the help of a rectangular mask.
                    Find the contours in the mask with the help of 'findContours' We will go through them all and with
                    the help of 'contourArea' Any Contour above a certain threshold will be considered a vehicle - will
                    receive an ID, and its representation as a label on the image. We will look for points of interest
                    in each of the 'Contours'. Each such vehicle will be included in the list.
                    We will look for the same vehicle in the next frame, we will look for points of interest as before
                    and then we will calculate movement with the help of 'calcopticalflowpyrlk' between the old points
                    of the vehicles in the list, we will remove irrelevant points,
                    And we will update the location of the labels.
